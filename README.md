# **A✰ Visualizator**

**A✰ Visualizator** as it name implies it's a visualizator for the **A\* search algorithm**. I made it in **C++ using SFML library**

## **How to use**
    1. Execute sfml-app.exe
    2. Input your maze size (It must be a square btw)
    3. Click on the cells that you want to be a wall
    4. Right-click on the start of your maze
    5. Right-click on the end of your maze
    6. Press enter
    7. Watch the algorithm solve your maze
